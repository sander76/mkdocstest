# Powerview® Quick Start Guide.
This guide will help getting you started with your Powerview® purchase.

### Step 1. Install your shades.
Make sure you have properly installed your shades and that they are connected to a power source (battery pack or powersupply).

### Step 2. Your Powerview® components.
Packed with your purchased product you will find one or more remotes, repeaters and a Hub (which is optional and only required when you want to control your shades using a tablet or smartphone). Remotes come in different shapes and colours. Please locate them all before you start.

### Step 3. Pairing remotes.

!!! Note
    If you only have one remote, please proceed to [step 4](#step_4_adding_a_shade_to_a_remote).

By pairing PowerView® remotes you make all your remotes part of the same PowerView® Network. This is important for seamless installation of the PowerView® system.
